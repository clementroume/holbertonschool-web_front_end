## Description

This project provides hands-on experience with advanced client-side scripting techniques in jQuery. Through a series of tasks, it demonstrates how to manipulate HTML documents, handle user events, and make asynchronous server requests using AJAX—all using jQuery.

The tasks build incrementally and cover the following concepts:

- Dynamically creating and updating elements in the DOM.
- Handling user interactions with click listeners.
- Sending GET, POST, and DELETE requests to a local **JSON Server**.
- Managing and displaying paginated data with custom loaders and dynamic content updates.

## Project Structure

The `jQuery_advanced` directory includes the following files:

| File           | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0-index.html` | Sets up the jQuery environment and checks if the jQuery CDN is loaded.       |
| `1-index.html` | Generates a paragraph element and appends it to the body using jQuery.      |
| `2-index.html` | Creates a table displaying a family tree with specific rows and columns.    |
| `3-index.html` | Reuses the family tree function but creates each element one by one, appending them using jQuery chain methods. |
| `4-index.html` | Adds a replaceFamilyTree function that replaces the tbody content with a new row. |
| `5-index.html` | Builds a family tree table using two functions: createFamilyTree and addNewMember. |
| `6-index.html` | Adds a form above the table with inputs for first name, last name, and a select to choose whether to insert the new member before or after existing rows. |
| `7-index.html` | Creates a search form and queries the Wikipedia API using AJAX. |
| `8-index.html` | Enhances the search form with pagination functionality. |
| `9-index.html` | Adds a loading state while querying the API. |
| `10-index.html` | Fetches posts from a local JSON server and displays them. |
| `11-index.html` | Adds a form for submitting new posts and dynamically adds the post to the list. |
| `12-index.html` | Adds functionality to delete posts with a DELETE request. |
