## Description  

Web accessibility ensures that all users, regardless of disabilities, can navigate, understand, and interact with websites effectively. This project explores the fundamental principles of accessibility, including **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications), WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), and assistive technologies**.  

The objective is to create web pages that comply with accessibility standards and provide a better user experience for individuals with **visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments**.  

The project includes:  

- Analyzing the importance of accessibility in modern web development.  
- Implementing **WCAG conformance levels (A, AA, AAA)** and evaluating their impact.  
- Exploring **tools and techniques** for testing web accessibility.  
- Applying best practices in HTML and CSS to enhance accessibility.  

By following these principles, the project aims to produce **barrier-free** web applications that ensure equal access to digital content for everyone.
