/* 
  Task 100: Columns and operators - Create classes with different column widths
  This file demonstrates how to use a `@for` loop to generate classes for different column widths.
  It creates classes `.col-1` to `.col-4` with respective widths of 100%, 50%, 33.33%, and 25%.
  The `@for` directive is used to iterate over the range from 1 to 4, and the `math.div()` function 
  is used to calculate the width for each class.

@use 'sass:math';

@for $i from 1 to 5 {
  .col-#{$i} {
    width: math.div(100%, $i);
  }
}
