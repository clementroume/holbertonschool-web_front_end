 * 100 - Columns and operators

 * This Sass file generates classes with different column widths.
 * It uses a @for loop to create four column classes
 * The width of each column is calculated by dividing 100% by the column number.
 * Sass math functions are used for the division to ensure proper handling of the percentages.
