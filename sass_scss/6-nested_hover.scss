/* 
  Task 6: Nested hover
  This Sass file demonstrates how to apply different styles to an element 
  when it is hovered over. It sets the text color of <button> elements to 
  #FF0000, and changes the text color to #00FF00 when the button is hovered.

button {
  color: #ff0000;
  &:hover {
    color: #00ff00;
