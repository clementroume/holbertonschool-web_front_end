/* 
  Task 11: For each - Loop through a list of names and create classes for each name 
  that assign background images based on the name.
  This file demonstrates the use of the `@each` directive to loop over a list of names 
  and create a class for each one. Each class will assign a background image using the `image-url()` function.

// Loop through each name in the $list-names variable

    // Dynamically create a class for each name
    background: image-url('photos/#{$name}.jpg')
      no-repeat; // Use the name to set the background image
