  Task 101: Media query #0 - Adjust the font size of h1 tags based on screen width
  This file sets the font size of h1 tags to 20px by default. It also includes a media query
  to change the font size to 14px when the screen width is smaller than 320px.
  This demonstrates how to use media queries in Sass to create responsive designs.

h1 {
  font-size: 20px;
  @media (max-width: 320px) {
    font-size: 14px;
