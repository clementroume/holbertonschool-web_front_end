## Description  

This project explores the creation and styling of **HTML5 forms**, a fundamental skill for web developers. Through progressive tasks, various techniques for designing, validating, and enhancing forms are applied to build user-friendly interfaces.  

The project focuses on understanding how to:  

- Select appropriate input types for diverse use cases.  
- Constrain and validate form fields using regular expressions and HTML attributes.  
- Style forms for visual feedback on validity, required fields, and accessibility.  

Practical scenarios include building comment forms, search forms, and other common web components. Each task emphasizes usability, accessibility, and adherence to modern web standards.

## Project Structure  

The `form` directory includes the following files:  

| File              | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 00-article.html   | Starter HTML file.                                           |
| 00-styles.css     | Starter CSS file.                                            |
| `01-article.html` | HTML file that creates a new section (`post-comments`) with a heading and a form for leaving comments. It also includes a message indicating that all fields are required. |
| `01-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the `post-comments` section, including layout adjustments and basic form styling. Focuses on the width, margin, padding, and font settings. |
|                   |                                                              |
