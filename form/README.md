## Description  

This project explores the creation and styling of **HTML5 forms**, a fundamental skill for web developers. Through progressive tasks, various techniques for designing, validating, and enhancing forms are applied to build user-friendly interfaces.  

The project focuses on understanding how to:  

- Select appropriate input types for diverse use cases.  
- Constrain and validate form fields using regular expressions and HTML attributes.  
- Style forms for visual feedback on validity, required fields, and accessibility.  

Practical scenarios include building comment forms, search forms, and other common web components. Each task emphasizes usability, accessibility, and adherence to modern web standards.

## Project Structure  

The `form` directory includes the following files:  

| File              | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `00-article.html` | Starter HTML file.                                           |
| `00-styles.css`   | Starter CSS file.                                            |
| `01-article.html` | HTML file that creates a new section (`post-comments`) with a heading and a form for leaving comments. It also includes a message indicating that all fields are required. |
| `01-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the `post-comments` section, including layout adjustments and basic form styling. Focuses on the width, margin, padding, and font settings. |
| `02-article.html` | HTML file that extends the previous comment form by adding two fieldsets for personal information and comment, each containing multiple `div` elements for structuring input fields. |
| `02-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the `fieldset` elements to use `flex` display, with specific properties for padding, layout direction, and border removal. |
| `03-article.html` | HTML file that enhances the form by adding labels and input containers for each field, using `div`elements with appropriate classes to structure the form and a button for submitting the comment. |
| `03-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the `label` elements to improve user interaction, including pointer cursor, block display, and specific font sizing and padding. It also includes hover styles for the submit button. |
| `04-article.html` | HTML file that completes the form by adding input fields for first name, last name, email, title, and a textarea for the comment, each with appropriate attributes such as pattern, placeholder, and required validation. |
| `04-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the input fields and textarea, setting common properties like padding, border, background color, and box-shadow. It also includes custom focus styles and placeholder styling for better visual presentation. |
| `05-article.html` | HTML file that adds help messages under each form field with the class `form-help`. The help messages provide additional guidance on the required input for fields such as first name, last name, title, and comment. |
| `05-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the help messages and form fields. It includes properties for form group padding and margin, background color, focus state transitions, and styling for the help text to make it more readable and accessible. |
| `06-article.html` |                                                              |
| `06-styles.css`   |                                                              |
| `07-article.html` |                                                              |
| `07-styles.css`   |                                                              |

## Learning Objectives  

By the end of this project, the following concepts should be mastered:  

- Create and structure HTML5 forms for various use cases.  
- Choose appropriate input types for different kinds of data collection.  
- Constrain form fields using regular expressions for validation.  
- Style inputs for visual feedback on validity, required fields, and states.  
- Build functional comment and search forms.  
- Ensure forms are usable and accessible, following best practices for user experience.  

Mastering forms through this project equips developers to build interfaces that enhance user interaction and data collection in web applications.
