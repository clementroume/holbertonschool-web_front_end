## Description  

This project explores the creation and styling of **HTML5 forms**, an essential skill for web developers. Through a series of progressive tasks, various techniques for designing, validating, and enhancing forms are applied to build user-friendly interfaces.  

The project focuses on the following key concepts:

- Selecting appropriate input types for various use cases.  
- Constraining and validating form fields using regular expressions and HTML attributes.  
- Styling forms to provide visual feedback on validity, required fields, and accessibility.  

Practical scenarios include creating comment forms, search forms, and other common web components. Each task emphasizes **usability**, **accessibility**, and adherence to **modern web standards**.

## Project Structure  

The `form` directory includes the following files:  

| File              | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `00-article.html` | Starter HTML file.                                           |
| `00-styles.css`   | Starter CSS file.                                            |
| `01-article.html` | HTML file that creates a new section (`post-comments`) with a heading and a form for leaving comments. It also includes a message indicating that all fields are required. |
| `01-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the `post-comments` section, including layout adjustments and basic form styling. |
| `02-article.html` | HTML file that extends the previous comment form by adding two fieldsets for personal information and comment, each containing multiple `div` elements for structuring input fields. |
| `02-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the `fieldset` elements to use `flex` display, with specific properties for padding, layout direction, and border removal. |
| `03-article.html` | HTML file that enhances the form by adding labels and input containers for each field, using `div` elements with appropriate classes to structure the form and a button for submitting the comment. |
| `03-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the `label` elements to improve user interaction, including pointer cursor, block display, and specific font sizing and padding. It also includes hover styles for the submit button. |
| `04-article.html` | HTML file that completes the form by adding input fields for first name, last name, email, title, and a textarea for the comment, each with appropriate attributes such as pattern, placeholder, and required validation. |
| `04-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the input fields and textarea, setting common properties like padding, border, background color, and box-shadow. It also includes custom focus styles and placeholder styling for better visual presentation. |
| `05-article.html` | HTML file that adds help messages under each form field with the class `form-help`. The help messages provide additional guidance on the required input for fields such as first name, last name, title, and comment. |
| `05-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the help messages and form fields. It includes properties for form group padding and margin, background color, focus state transitions, and styling for the help text to make it more readable and accessible. |
| `06-article.html` | HTML file that remains unchanged in this step. It utilizes the validation and error handling styles from the corresponding CSS file to display the error and success messages when the form inputs are valid or invalid. |
| `06-styles.css`   | CSS file that adds custom properties for error and success colors, as well as styles for error handling in form fields. This includes custom icons for valid and invalid inputs, and adjustments to the visual appearance of the form fields based on their validation state. |
| `07-article.html` | HTML file that adds a search form inside the navigation. The form contains an input field for search queries and a button with an SVG search icon. The form allows users to search through the site content. |
| `07-styles.css`   | CSS file that styles the newly added search form. It includes properties for the search input, button, and icon, as well as animations for the input field's width during focus and interaction. |

## Learning Objectives  

By the end of this project, the following concepts should be mastered:  

- Structure HTML5 forms for various use cases.  
- Choose and implement appropriate input types (e.g., text, email, search, textarea).  
- Constrain form fields using regular expressions for validation.  
- Style form elements to provide visual feedback on validity, required fields, and states.  
- Build functional comment and search forms.  
- Ensure forms are usable and accessible, following best practices for user experience.  

Mastering forms through this project equips developers to create interfaces that enhance user interaction and data collection in web applications.
